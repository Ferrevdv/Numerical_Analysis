# Numerical_Analysis

A project completed for the Numerical Analysis course at KU Leuven.

In the first part we analysed the numerical stability and mathematical properties of Vandermonde matrices, which play an important part in numerical analsysis (e.g. interpolation in monomial basis, Gaussian quadrature, ...). In the second part we approximate a Lissajous figure with cubic B-splines from the ground-up to illustrate the workings of spline interpolation. Our findings are summarized in a concise [report](https://github.com/Ferrevdv/Numerical_Analysis/blob/main/report.pdf) with explanatory figures.
